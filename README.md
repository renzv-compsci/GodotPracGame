<h1 align="center">🐔 Godot Practice Game</h1>

<p align="center">
Welcome to <b>GodotPracGame</b>!<br>
This is my sandbox playground for all things Godot. It’s not a polished game—think of it as my digital sketchbook where I test, break, and learn from all sorts of game dev experiments. 🎮✨

<h2 align="center">🎯 What is This?</h2>

<p align="center">
This repository is <b>intended purely for practice</b> as I get comfortable with the Godot Engine.<br>
Here, you’ll find:<br>
• <b>Buttons</b> that do things (sometimes even what I intended)<br>
• <b>Game loops</b> that keep the action going<br>
• <b>Collision detection</b> (because dodging is fun)<br>
• <b>Character design</b> (hello, chickens!)<br>
• <b>Backgrounds & tiles</b> that set the scene
</p>

<p align="center">
It’s not perfect, but every script, sprite, and bug squashed is a step forward in my learning journey!

<h2 align="center">🛠️ Features & Learnings</h2>

<p align="center">
• <b>Clickable UI Buttons</b> (like Play, Restart, and Quit)<br>
• <b>Game World Loop</b> (spawning, updating, game over events)<br>
• <b>Simple Collision Handling</b> (arrows, chickens, oh my!)<br>
• <b>Animated Characters</b> (with running, jumping, and falling)<br>
• <b>Scrolling Backgrounds & Tilemaps</b> (for that classic platformer vibe)
</p>

<h2 align="center">🎨 Art & Assets</h2>

<p align="center">
<b>All of the sprites, backgrounds, and tiles in this project are my own original work.</b> <br>
They're a big part of my learning journey and creative exploration. Please enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them!

<p align="center">
There’s <b>no sound or music</b> in this project right now. <br>
Maybe in a future update I’ll add some funky tunes or silly effects! <br>
